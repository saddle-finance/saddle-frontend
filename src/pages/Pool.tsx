          Liquidity pools, in essence, are pools of tokens that are locked in a
          smart contract. They are used to facilitate trading by providing
          liquidity and are extensively used by some of the decentralized
          exchanges a.k.a DEXes.
          <br />
          <br />
          When liquidity is supplied to a pool, the liquidity provider (LP)
          receives special tokens called LP tokens in proportion to how much
          liquidity they supplied to the pool. When a trade is facilitated by
          the pool a 0.04% fee is proportionally distributed amongst all the LP
          token holders. If the liquidity provider wants to get their underlying
          liquidity back, plus any accrued fees, they must burn their LP tokens.
